1. BLOCKS :  It is a collection of data containing multiple transactions over a given period of time on blockchain network.

2. CHAIN : Using cryptographic links, we connect one block to another using hash function.

3. BLOCKCHAIN : It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, secure and immutable ledger of synchronized data. 

4. HASH : It is an output of an algorithmic function which converts data to a random string of numbers and letters.

5. DECENTRALIZED : A system where no individual owns it, which leads to absence of central ownership. This system is spread over the network of users.

6. SMART CONTRACTS : A contract is basically an agreement on which two or more entity agree to continue with. With the same idea, a smart contract is an agreement between two people or digital device where contracts agreed on cannot be manipulated.

7. SOLIDITY : It is a high level, object oriented programming language used for preparing smart contract. Compiled using Solc complier.
